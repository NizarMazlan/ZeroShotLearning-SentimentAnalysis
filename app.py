In real life situation, new concepts, topics and fields emerge, a trained model would be obsolete as unforeseen and new data will always be created""")

    Next for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, removal of null values and duplicates is being done. Transformation of data to standardize accorss all datasets. Then whitespaces is unified, punctuations are removed and the data is being cleaned of emojis, basic characters and numbers. Last but not least is the removal of stopwords and the act of stemming.

    Then proceed with Building Models. Three different algorithm is being used in this project, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). Each model will be trained and tested on each of the datasets as much as five times. 

    For Evaluation, each model's result created will be collected and mean of it will be used to evaluate which dataset perform well and did not. Confusion matrix is used to calculate the accuracy. The result will be tabulated for a better Visualization""")

    - Zero-shot learning is a setup in which a model can learn to recognize things that it hasn't explicitly seen before in training.
    - From the built models and it's test accuracy is lower when tested on an unseen dataset. Although Food Review Dataset performed well when trained and tested on other dataset.
    - Faced a challenge of having an unbalanced data in all of the dataset, result tend to be biased and some datesets does not include a neutral sentiment.
    - Future works can consider having a more comprehensive parameter-tuning and using other approaches
